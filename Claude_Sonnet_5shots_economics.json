National income is meant to measure the current production of goods and services in an economy.\n\n3. Interest payments on private bonds are included because they represent a return on investment in productive activities. When private firms issue bonds, they typically use the funds for business operations or expansion, which contributes to current economic output.\n\n4. Government bonds, however, are different. They are often issued to finance government spending or to refinance existing debt, rather than to fund new productive activities.\n\n5. The interest payments on government bonds are essentially a transfer of money from taxpayers to bondholders. They don't represent any new production of goods or services.\n\n6. Therefore, including interest on government bonds in national income would overstate the actual production in the economy.\n\n7. Looking at our options, the one that best captures this reasoning is: \"Interest paid on such debt does not reflect the generation of any current output or income.\"\n\nThe answer is (E)."

It's not about increased costs of goods and services (D), as that's just describing inflation itself, not the \"tax\" aspect.\n\n3. It's not about adding to cash balances (G), as inflation actually erodes the value of cash balances.\n\n4. The key concept of the inflation tax is that it represents a loss in the value of money held by the public due to inflation.\n\n5. This loss in value can be seen as an indirect form of taxation, as it reduces purchasing power without the government directly taking money from people.\n\n6. The government can benefit from this by issuing more money (which causes inflation), effectively transferring purchasing power from the public to the government.\n\n7. Options C and F both capture aspects of this concept correctly.\n\n8. However, F provides a more comprehensive and precise definition of the inflation tax.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (F). The inflation tax is the reduced purchasing power of money held by the public due to an increase in the overall price level."

Conversely, when a resource is abundant, its price decreases, encouraging more use of that resource.\n\n6.

Efficiency in agriculture doesn't necessarily mean a country produces all types of food in sufficient quantities for its population.\n\n2.

The amount a bank can lend is determined by the reserve requirement. If there's no required reserve ratio, theoretically, the bank could lend out the entire deposit.\n\n3. When the bank lends out money, it creates new deposits in the banking system, which can then be lent out again.\n\n4. This process can continue indefinitely if there's no reserve requirement.\n\n5. Each time the money is deposited and re-lent, it adds to the money supply.\n\n6. With no reserve requirement to limit this process, the initial $1 deposit could theoretically be lent out and re-deposited an infinite number of times.\n\n7. As this process continues indefinitely, the money supply could expand without limit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E). The $1 deposit could theoretically expand the money supply infinitely in the absence of a required reserve ratio.\n\nThe answer is (E)."

The model suggests that the growth rate of an economy is directly related to the savings rate and inversely related to the capital-output ratio.\n\n3. The Keynesian theory of savings posits that the savings rate increases as income increases. In other words, richer people (and countries) tend to save a higher proportion of their income.\n\n4. Combining these two theories:\n   - Rich countries would have higher savings rates\n   - Higher savings rates lead to higher growth rates according to the Harrod-Domar model\n\n5. The implication for poor countries is:\n   - They would have lower savings rates\n   - Lower savings rates would lead to lower growth rates\n\n6.

Looking at our options, the one that matches this approach is:\n   G. increase government spending and reduce taxes.\n\nThis policy would provide both direct and indirect stimulus to the economy, which is typically considered the most effective fiscal approach to addressing a recession.\n\nThe answer is (G)."

This question is specifically asking about a decrease in price and its immediate effect on quantity demanded.\n\n4. It's important to note that this is not asking about a change in demand (which would shift the entire demand curve), but rather a movement along the existing demand curve.\n\n5.

First, let's recall the different types of unemployment:\n\n   - Seasonal: Due to regular changes in demand based on seasons\n   - Structural: Due to fundamental changes in the economy or technology\n   - Cyclical: Due to business cycle fluctuations\n   - Frictional: Due to time taken to find new jobs\n   - Voluntary: When people choose not to work\n\n2. In this scenario, you're being replaced by a machine (self-serve checkout stations).\n\n3. This is not due to seasons changing, so it's not seasonal unemployment.\n\n4. It's not due to economic cycles, so it's not cyclical.\n\n5. You didn't choose to leave your job, so it's not voluntary.\n\n6. It's not about the time taken to find a new job, so it's not frictional.\n\n7. This situation represents a fundamental change in technology where machines are replacing human workers.

The goal of fiscal policy during a recession is to stimulate the economy.\n\n3. There are two main tools of fiscal policy: government spending and taxation.\n\n4. To stimulate the economy, the government can:\n   a) Increase government spending, which directly adds to economic activity\n   b) Decrease taxes, which leaves more money in the hands of consumers and businesses to spend\n\n5. Both of these actions (increasing spending and decreasing taxes) will typically result in the government spending more than it receives in revenue.\n\n6. When the government spends more than it receives, it runs a deficit.\n\n7. Therefore, the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession typically involves the government running a deficit.\n\nThe answer is (A): calls for the federal government to run a deficit."

To counteract this, the central bank would need to implement an expansionary monetary policy to keep interest rates low.\n\n4. Expansionary monetary policy options include:\n   - Lowering the reserve ratio\n   - Lowering the discount rate\n   - Buying government securities (open market operations)\n\n5.

At this point:\n   - Mr. X's deposit: $1000\n   - Mr. Y's new loan deposit: $500\n   - Currency in circulation: $0 (as the original $1000 is now in the bank)\n\n5. The total money supply is now $1500 ($1000 + $500), compared to the original $1000.\n\n6. However, the question asks for the \"immediate effect\". The loan to Mr. Y might not be considered immediate, as it's a separate action from the deposit.\n\n7. If we only consider the deposit action as immediate, then there is no change in the money supply. The $1000 has simply changed form from currency to a bank deposit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C). The immediate effect is no change in the money supply.\n\nThe answer is (C)."

The circular flow model is a basic economic model that shows how money and goods/services flow between households and firms in an economy.\n\n2. In this model, there are two main markets:\n   - The resource (or factor) market, where households sell their labor, land, and capital to firms\n   - The product market, where firms sell goods and services to households\n\n3. The key principle in both these markets is that prices are determined by the interaction of supply and demand.\n\n4. In the resource market:\n   - Households supply resources (labor, land, capital)\n   - Firms demand these resources\n   - The price (wages, rent, interest) is determined where supply meets demand\n\n5.

Economic growth is typically defined as an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy over time, usually measured by an increase in GDP.\n\n2. Now, let's consider what happens during a recession and recovery:\n   - During a recession, economic output decreases.\n   - During recovery, economic output increases again.\n\n3.

First, we need to calculate the current GNP:\n   Savings + Consumption + Taxes = GNP\n   0.1Y + 0.65Y + 0.25Y = Y, where Y is GNP\n   Y = $1000 billion\n\n2. Now, let's calculate tax revenue:\n   0.25 * $1000 billion = $250 billion\n\n3. Current deficit = Government Expenditure - Tax Revenue\n   Current deficit = $270 billion - $250 billion = $20 billion\n\n4. For full employment deficit, we use full capacity GNP of $1060 billion:\n   Tax revenue at full employment = 0.25 * $1060 billion = $265 billion\n   Full employment deficit = $270 billion - $265 billion = $5 billion\n\n5. Comparing the two:\n   Current deficit ($20 billion) > Full employment deficit ($5 billion)\n\n6. This means the current budget is expansionary, as it's running a larger deficit than it would at full employment.\n\nThe answer is (H). The current deficit is $20 billion."

Smith observed that breaking down production into many small, specialized tasks could greatly increase efficiency.\n\n4. He used the example of a pin factory, where dividing the pin-making process into about 18 distinct operations allowed workers to produce far more pins than if each worker made entire pins from start to finish.\n\n5. This concept of specialization and task division to increase productivity is the essence of the division of labor.\n\n6.

When trade opens up:\n   - US consumers will want to buy from the world market at the lower price\n   - This will create a surplus of domestically produced rice, as US producers can't compete with the lower world price\n\n4. To resolve this situation:\n   - The US will start importing rice to meet consumer demand at the lower world price\n   - This will eliminate the surplus of domestically produced rice, as domestic production will decrease\n\n5.

In this scenario, Firm A believes that B and C will follow any price change it initiates, whether it's an increase or a decrease.\n\n4.

This leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve will reduce output and lower prices, bringing the economy back to its potential output level.\n\n5. The aggregate supply curve doesn't need to be shifted in this scenario.\n\n6. Looking at our options, the one that matches this description is G: \"the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is (G)."

Imports are subtracted from exports to calculate net exports.\n\n3. An increase in imports leads to a decrease in net exports.\n\n4. However, this transaction doesn't directly affect U.S. GDP because:\n   - The product wasn't produced in the U.S., so it doesn't count as domestic production.\n   - The consumer spending is offset by the subtraction of imports in the GDP calculation.\n\n5. The GDP equation is: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\n   Where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, X is exports, and M is imports.\n\n6. In this case, C increases (American consumer spending), but M also increases by the same amount, canceling out in the GDP calculation.\n\n7. Therefore, GDP remains unchanged, while net exports decrease.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is that net exports fall and there is no change in GDP.\n\nThe answer is (J)."

This is because at this point, the marginal benefit to consumers (represented by price) equals the marginal cost of production.\n\n2. In a natural monopoly, the firm's average total cost curve is continuously decreasing due to economies of scale. This means that at any given output level, average total cost is higher than marginal cost.\n\n3. If left unregulated, a monopoly would produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, which results in a price higher than marginal cost and a quantity lower than the allocatively efficient level.\n\n4. To achieve allocative efficiency, the government would need to regulate the monopoly to produce where price equals marginal cost.\n\n5.

Scarcity is a fundamental concept in economics, referring to the basic economic problem that there are limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants.\n\n4. This concept of scarcity underlies all economic decision-making and resource allocation.\n\n5. In the circular flow model:\n   - Households have limited income to spend on goods and services (scarcity of financial resources)\n   - Businesses have limited factors of production (scarcity of labor, capital, land, etc.)\n   - The flow of goods and services is limited by these scarce resources\n\n6. Therefore, scarcity is not explicitly shown in the circular flow diagram, but it is an underlying assumption that affects all parts of the model.\n\n7. The concept of scarcity is what drives the economic decisions represented in the circular flow model.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that scarcity is implicit in the entire analysis of the circular flow model.

In a normal economic environment, interest rates and inflation are closely related. When inflation rises, interest rates typically rise as well.\n\n3. This is because lenders want to maintain their real return (the return after accounting for inflation). If inflation is eating away at the value of money, lenders will demand higher interest rates to compensate.\n\n4. In the case of permanent inflation, this relationship becomes even more pronounced.\n\n5. When inflation is expected to be permanent, lenders will consistently demand higher nominal interest rates to protect their real returns.\n\n6. This means that the nominal interest rate will typically include two components: the \"real\" interest rate plus an inflation premium.\n\n7. In other words, the interest rates become \"discounted\" by the anticipated rate of inflation. Lenders build in this inflation expectation when setting interest rates.\n\n8.

The concave shape of the PPF is important and has a specific economic meaning.\n\n3. As we move along the PPF, we're reallocating resources from producing one good to producing the other.\n\n4. Initially, we're using resources best suited for the new good, so we gain a lot of the new good for little loss of the original good.\n\n5. As we continue reallocating, we start using resources less well-suited for the new good, so we gain less of the new good for each unit of the original good we give up.\n\n6.

The law of increasing costs states that as the production of a good increases, the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit generally increases.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the option that best describes why production possibilities frontiers are concave to the origin is \"G. of the law of increasing costs.\"\n\nThe answer is (G)."

Price discrimination is a pricing strategy where a company charges different prices to different consumers for the same product or service.\n\n2. The goal of price discrimination is to capture more consumer surplus and increase profits.\n\n3. To maximize profits, a firm will charge higher prices to consumers who are willing to pay more (those with inelastic demand) and lower prices to consumers who are more price-sensitive (those with elastic demand).\n\n4. This is because consumers with inelastic demand will still buy the product even at a higher price, while those with elastic demand might not buy if the price is too high.\n\n5. Therefore, market segments with relatively elastic demand will pay lower prices, while those with relatively inelastic demand will pay higher prices.\n\n6. This strategy allows the firm to capture more consumer surplus, which means consumer surplus typically decreases when price discrimination is implemented.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\nThe answer is (A). When the opportunity for price discrimination arises, market segments with relatively elastic demand pay lower prices."

Supply refers to the amount of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at each possible price.\n\n2. The supply curve shows this relationship between price and quantity supplied. It's important to note that the supply curve itself represents the supply.\n\n3. In this scenario, we're told that the price of corn dropped from $1.00 to $0.75 per bushel.\n\n4. In response to this price change, farmers decided to sell one-third less corn.\n\n5. This means that at the new, lower price, farmers are willing to supply less corn than they were at the higher price.\n\n6. This relationship between price and quantity supplied (lower price leading to lower quantity supplied) is exactly what the supply curve represents.\n\n7. The farmers' decision to sell less corn at the lower price is a movement along the existing supply curve, not a shift of the entire supply curve.\n\n8. A decrease in supply would mean the entire supply curve has shifted to the left, which is not what's happening here.\n\nTherefore, this scenario does not represent a decrease in supply.

This assumes that banks lend out all of their excess reserves (as stated in the question, they maintain no excess reserves) and that there's no change in the public's currency holdings.\n\nTherefore, the effect on the money supply will be an increase of $1,000,000.\n\nThe answer is (G)."

It doesn't have a probability distribution.\n\n3. One of the key assumptions of the standard regression model is that the disturbance term (error term) is uncorrelated with x. If it were correlated, this would lead to endogeneity issues.\n\n4. The residuals (u-hat) are the differences between the observed y values and the predicted y values from the regression line. In a good model, these residuals should be small, but they won't be zero for all data points. If they were, it would suggest perfect prediction, which is extremely unlikely in real-world data.\n\nBased on these considerations:\n\nA is true\nB is false\nC is false\nD is false\n\nThe answer is (A)."

Decreasing spending on public services could negatively impact infrastructure and social support systems, potentially harming productivity and growth.\nC. Ignoring societal barriers like discrimination would not help and could potentially hinder economic participation.\nD. Promoting monopolies typically reduces competition and innovation, which can harm productivity and growth.\nE. Imposing tariffs and quotas generally reduces trade, which can limit economic growth.\nF. Subsidizing education for all citizens can increase human capital, leading to higher productivity and economic growth.\nG. Removing penalties for pollution could lead to environmental degradation, which may harm long-term economic growth.\nH. Increasing taxes on businesses could discourage investment and potentially reduce economic growth.\nI.

In economic theory, government spending typically has a larger multiplier effect than taxation.

If the products were exactly the same, firms would not have any market power, which is a key feature of monopolistic competition.\n\n6. Therefore, it is not possible for many firms to sell exactly the same product and still be in monopolistic competition.\n\nThe answer is (D). No, it is not possible."

However, the fact that they need to lower prices to stimulate purchasing suggests they face competition from other firms.\n\n4.

The key features of capitalism include:\n   - Private property rights\n   - Capital accumulation\n   - Wage labor\n   - Voluntary exchange\n   - A price system\n   - Competitive markets\n\n3. Among these features, private property is the most fundamental and distinguishing characteristic of capitalism.\n\n4. Without private property rights, the other aspects of capitalism (like capital accumulation, wage labor, and competitive markets) would not be possible or would function very differently.\n\n5. The institution of private property allows individuals and businesses to own assets, use them to generate profits, and have legal protection for their ownership.\n\n6. This is in contrast to systems like communism or socialism, which emphasize collective or state ownership of property.\n\n7. Looking at our options, the one that most closely aligns with this core principle of capitalism is \"The institution of private property\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is (J).\n\nThe answer is (J)."

If investment is not very sensitive to interest rates, then even a small increase in interest rates (caused by expansionary fiscal policy) will lead to a larger reduction in private investment.\n\n5. This means that when the investment demand curve is inelastic, there will be more crowding out.\n\n6. Looking at our options, we can see that option F directly states \"the investment demand curve is inelastic\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is (F). There is relatively more crowding out as the result of expansionary fiscal policy when the investment demand curve is inelastic."

The profit-maximizing rule states that a firm should hire workers up to the point where MRPL = wage rate.\n\n6. Since MRPL > wage rate, the firm should hire more workers.\n\n7.

    "model_outputs": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what \"derived demand\" means. It refers to a demand that exists as a result of demand for something else.\n\n2. In economics, the demand for factors of production (like land, labor, or capital) is typically derived from the demand for the final goods or services that these factors help produce.\n\n3. Land, as a factor of production, is used to produce various goods and services that consumers want.\n\n4. Therefore, the demand for land doesn't exist for its own sake, but because of the demand for the products that can be produced using that land.\n\n5. Looking at our options, we can see that option F directly addresses this concept: \"The demand for land is derived from consumers' desires and demands for final goods.\"\n\n6. This option correctly links the demand for land (a factor of production) to the demand for final goods, which is the essence of derived demand.\n\n7. The other options either don't address derived demand or focus on secondary factors that might influence land demand but don't capture the core concept of derived demand in economics.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (F). The demand for land is derived from consumers' desires and demands for final goods."

The question is about how trade compensates for the immobility of resources in a world with restrictions on movement of labor and capital.\n\n2. Comparative advantage is a key concept here. It suggests that countries should specialize in producing goods they can make most efficiently relative to other goods.\n\n3. When countries trade based on comparative advantage, it allows for a more efficient allocation of resources globally, even if those resources can't physically move.\n\n4. This happens because:\n   - Countries produce more of what they're comparatively good at\n   - They export their surplus\n   - They import what other countries are comparatively better at producing\n\n5. This process tends to balance out supply and demand on a global scale:\n   - Excess supply in one country can meet demand in another\n   - Prices adjust to reflect global supply and demand, not just local conditions\n\n6. As a result, trade acts as a substitute for physical resource mobility. Resources don't need to move; instead, the products of those resources move.\n\n7. This doesn't perfectly match supply and demand, but it does so \"roughly\" or approximately.\n\nLooking at the options, the one that best describes this process is:\n\nC.

This is because:\n   - The price represents the consumer's willingness to pay for an additional unit.\n   - The marginal cost represents the cost to society of producing an additional unit.\n\n5.

    "model_outputs": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The FED adds $500,000 to reserves.\n\n2. The required reserve ratio is 30%, which means the money multiplier is 1/0.3 = 3.33 (rounded).\n\n3. Theoretically, this could create $500,000 * 3.33 = $1,665,000 in new money.\n\n4. However, the public increases its currency holdings by $200,000. This money is taken out of the banking system and doesn't multiply.\n\n5. So, the actual amount available for multiplication is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.\n\n6. This $300,000 will multiply by 3.33: $300,000 * 3.33 = $999,000.\n\n7.

Mutual savings banks traditionally specialize in mortgages and savings accounts, while commercial banks offer a wider range of services.\n\n2.

Increased competition typically leads to:\n   - Lower interest rates on mortgages\n   - More mortgage product options for consumers\n   - Potentially easier access to mortgages\n\n4. Lower interest rates and easier access to mortgages would make it more affordable for people to buy homes.\n\n5. When more people can afford to buy homes, demand for housing increases.\n\n6. Increased demand for housing typically stimulates the housing construction industry.\n\n7.

    "model_outputs": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Diminishing marginal returns is a concept in economics that describes the decrease in the marginal (incremental) output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is increased, while the amounts of all other factors of production stay constant.\n\n2. In the context of labor (which is mentioned in the question), this means that as we add more units of labor while keeping other factors constant, the additional output produced by each additional unit of labor starts to decrease at some point.\n\n3. This doesn't mean that total output is decreasing, just that the rate of increase is slowing down.\n\n4. The key is to identify when this slowdown begins.\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - It's not when total product becomes negative or constant (eliminating A and E)\n   - It's not when average product becomes negative or constant (eliminating B and I)\n   - It's not when marginal product becomes negative or constant (eliminating C and D)\n   - It's not when total product begins to fall (eliminating H)\n   - It's not when both marginal and average product begin to fall (eliminating G)\n   - It's not when average product begins to fall (eliminating J)\n\n6. The correct point is when the marginal product of labor begins to fall. This is the exact moment when diminishing returns set in.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (F)."

Key Differences:\n   - PPF focuses on finished goods, while production function deals with inputs and outputs\n   - PPF shows trade-offs between goods, production function shows how inputs create output\n   - PPF is typically used for macroeconomic analysis, production function can be used for both micro and macro analysis\n\n4. Looking at the options, we can eliminate those that are clearly incorrect or mix up the concepts.\n\n5. Option A provides the most accurate and comprehensive distinction between the two concepts:\n   - It correctly describes the PPF as relating to finished consumer goods and societal production limits\n   - It accurately portrays the production function as describing the relationship between inputs and outputs\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A). The production possibility frontier refers to an outer limit on the finished consumer good that a society can produce given its resources and the state of technical knowledge, while the production function describes how various inputs should be employed in order to produce a given amount of output."

In economic theory, the accelerator effect is typically stronger during periods of economic growth than during periods of decline.\n\n4.

The Physiocrats believed that the wealth of nations was derived solely from the value of \"land agriculture\" or \"land development.\"\n\n4. They viewed the agricultural sector as the only productive sector of an economy, while all other sectors (industry, services) were seen as \"sterile\" or non-productive.\n\n5. Their reasoning was that agriculture was the only sector that could produce more value than was used in production (due to the natural growth of crops and animals), thus creating a surplus or \"net product.\"\n\n6.

The second sentence assumes that technological progress always contributes to maintaining competition.

In the long run, according to classical economic theory, the economy will always return to its full employment level of output.\n\n5. The tax cut doesn't change the economy's productive capacity or potential output.\n\n6. What will change is the price level. With more money chasing the same amount of goods (due to the tax cut increasing aggregate demand), prices will rise.\n\n7. This increase in the price level will offset the initial increase in aggregate demand, bringing the economy back to its full employment level of output.\n\n8.

The principle of diminishing returns states that as you add more of one factor of production while holding others constant, the marginal output will eventually decrease.\n\n2. In growth theory, this principle is applied to capital accumulation and population growth.\n\n3. If capital accumulation or population growth alone could indefinitely increase output, we would see continuous, unbounded economic growth just by increasing these factors.\n\n4. However, the principle of diminishing returns suggests that simply adding more capital or labor will eventually lead to smaller and smaller increases in output.\n\n5. This implies that there must be other factors beyond just capital and labor that drive long-term economic growth.\n\n6. These other factors are typically identified as technological progress and improvements in human capital (education, skills, etc.).\n\n7. Therefore, the principle of diminishing returns is crucial in explaining why economies can't grow indefinitely just through capital accumulation and population growth, and why technological progress is so important for sustained economic growth.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer that best captures this importance is:\n\nThe answer is (B): Diminishing marginal returns indicate that capital accumulation and population growth alone cannot indefinitely increase output."

There are several scenarios where national income could increase without a corresponding increase in employment:\n\n   a) Productivity improvements: If existing workers become more productive, output (and thus national income) can increase without hiring more workers.\n   \n   b) Capital-intensive growth: If growth is driven by investments in technology or machinery rather than labor, employment might not increase proportionally.\n   \n   c) Inflation: If the increase in national income is purely due to inflation, real economic growth might not have occurred, and employment may not change.\n\n3.

According to the balance of payments identity, these three accounts must sum to zero:\n   Current Account + Capital Account + Financial Account = 0\n\n3. If a country has a negative value on its current account, it means it's spending more on foreign trade than it's earning.\n\n4. To balance this out, there must be a positive inflow in either the capital account or the financial account (or a combination of both).\n\n5. In modern economics, the capital account is typically very small and often combined with the financial account.\n\n6. Therefore, a negative current account is typically offset by a positive financial account.\n\n7. A positive financial account means that foreigners are investing more in the country than the country's residents are investing abroad. This could be through foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, or other investments.\n\n8. This inflow of foreign capital is what allows the country to finance its current account deficit.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if a country has a negative value on its current account, it must have a positive value of equal magnitude on its financial account (which is often referred to as the capital account in less technical discussions).\n\nThe answer is (B)."
