The marginal physical product of capital (MPPK) is the change in output per unit of capital. We need to find the MPPK that makes the marginal cost of capital equal to the wage. \n\nThe wage is $4, and the rent is $1, so the marginal cost of capital is $5. \n\nMPPK = (3 * 1) / 7 = 3/7\n\nNow, we need to find the total cost, which is the product of the wage and the number of workers plus the product of the MPPK and the number of units of capital.\n\nTotal cost = (3 * $4) + (7 * MPPK * $1) = $12 + 7 * (3/7) * $1 = $12 + $3 = $15\n\nThe MPPK is 3/7, which is approximately 0.4333.

If a technological innovation raises the firm's marginal physical product but not that of others, it means the firm's output per worker increases. In a perfectly competitive market, firms cannot charge different prices, so they will not increase wages. However, they can increase output, which could lead to either more employment (if demand is elastic) or less (if demand is inelastic). The answer is (B) lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe answer is **B. lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages**."

The problem states that demand is elastic with an elasticity of -3, which means that a 1% decrease in price leads to a 3% increase in quantity sold. To sell 1000 frisbees, he needs to increase the quantity sold by 1000/500 = 2 times. So, a 1% decrease in price should lead to a 2% increase in quantity. Therefore, the new price should be 500/2 = 250% of the original price. Thus, the new price should be 5 * 250/100 = $2.50. The answer is (A)."

    "generated_text": " We refer to the concept of consumer surplus and producer surplus in microeconomics. The consumer surplus is the difference between what the consumer is willing to pay and what they actually pay, while the producer surplus is the difference between what the producer is willing to accept and what they actually receive. In this case, the negotiated price is $125, which is less than David's willingness to pay ($175), so the producer surplus is $50. The consumer surplus is $175 - $125 = $50. The difference between the two is $50, which is within the range of $50 to $75. Therefore, the correct statement is (E) Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe answer is (E)."

The capital depreciation rate is not given, but it's typically around 10-20% in developed economies. Let's calculate the growth rate:\nGrowth rate = (15%) * (2.5) - (10-20%)\nGrowth rate = 3.75 - 8% to 10% (approx.)\nThis falls between 3% and 5% per year.

The answer is (G).\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe answer is (F).赙赠性捐赠是指捐赠者没有直接获得经济利益的捐赠，通常用于慈善、教育、医疗等领域。在选择赙赠性捐赠时，考虑以下几个方面：\n\n1. 目标组织：选择有良好声誉、透明度高且与你关心的议题相符的组织。查看其财务报告、运营成果和公益活动，确保资金真正用于需要的地方。\n\n2. 项目或服务：了解捐赠的具体用途，比如帮助贫困儿童、支持环保项目或提供医疗援助。确保你的捐赠能直接改善受助人的生活。\n\n3. 长期影响：选择那些能产生长期积极影响的项目，而不是一次性支出。这可能意味着投资于教育或技能培训，帮助受助者自立。\n\n4."

The crowding-out effect occurs when expansionary fiscal policy (increased government spending) leads to higher interest rates, as the increased demand for credit reduces the amount of credit available in the market.

Easy money policies, often implemented by central banks like the Federal Reserve, involve lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy. This leads to an increase in demand, which could result in an increase in net exports (option A) if the economy is open and there are no trade barriers. However, it could also lead to an increase in inflation, which would push the real interest rate up (option C). The nominal interest rate, the stated interest rate, might not change immediately due to the time lag in monetary policy implementation. So, the most likely answer is (A) an increase in net exports.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe answer is A. an increase in net exports."
