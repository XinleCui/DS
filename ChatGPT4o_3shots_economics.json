This could contribute but isn't the fundamental problem\n- Price setting and compliance?

If demand is perfectly elastic (horizontal line), producers bear the entire tax burden. The price to consumers doesn't change.\n\n   B. When demand is more elastic, consumers can more easily switch to alternatives, forcing producers to absorb more of the tax burden. So this is false.\n\n   C. Consumer surplus always decreases with a tax as consumers face higher prices and lower quantities. So this is false.\n\n   D. When demand is less elastic, consumers cannot easily avoid the good, so they bear more of the tax burden. This is correct.\n\n4) The key principle is that the side of the market (supply or demand) that is less elastic bears more of the tax burden.\n\nThe answer is (D)."

Unemployment will rise - No, fiscal policy should reduce unemployment\nB. Taxes will have to be raised - Yes, eventually to pay for the increased spending/debt\nC.

Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds\n   - Lower reserve requirements ✓ (increases money supply)\n   - Lower discount rate ✓ (increases money supply)\n   - Buy bonds ✓ (increases money supply)\n\nB through H all contain at least one action that would decrease money supply:\n   - Selling bonds decreases money supply\n   - Raising reserve requirements decreases money supply\n   - Raising the discount rate decreases money supply\n\n3) Only option A contains all three actions that increase money supply.\n\nThe answer is (A)."
