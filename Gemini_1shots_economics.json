AIC and BIC have different penalty terms for model complexity. AIC generally favors larger models than BIC, but this isn't a strict rule.\n* (iv) Akaike's information criterion is consistent: AIC is not consistent. Consistency means that as the sample size increases, the criterion will select the true model with probability approaching 1. AIC is not consistent because it tends to overfit. BIC is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): (ii) and (iv) only \n",

Taxes, however, reduce disposable income, which in turn reduces consumption spending, thus impacting NNP.\n* MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume): This tells us how much of each additional dollar of income is spent on consumption. An MPC of 0.8 means that for every $1 increase in income, $0.80 is spent on consumption.\n\nThe Impact:\n\n1. Government Spending: The $100 billion in government spending directly increases NNP by $100 billion.\n\n2. Taxes: The $100 billion in taxes reduces disposable income.  Since the MPC is 0.8, this leads to a decrease in consumption spending of $80 billion (0.8 * $100 billion).\n\n3. Net Effect: The net impact on NNP is a decrease of $80 billion (due to reduced consumption) plus an increase of $100 billion (due to government spending), resulting in a net increase of $20 billion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E). \n",

This cost typically increases with each additional unit produced due to factors like diminishing returns.\n\n* Marginal Total Cost (MC): The marginal total cost is the change in total cost from producing one more unit.

Statistical models are designed to identify patterns and relationships in data, and when applied correctly, they can provide objective and consistent predictions.  Avoiding subjective judgment reduces the risk of bias and overfitting.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less likely to lead to high out-of-sample accuracy:\n\n* (A) A model that contains many variables:  While more variables can potentially capture more information, it also increases the risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on new data.\n* (B) A model that is based on financial theory: Financial theory can provide valuable insights, but it doesn't guarantee accurate predictions.  Markets are complex and constantly evolving, and theoretical models may not always capture all relevant factors.\n* (C) A model whose dependent variable has recently exhibited a structural change:  Structural changes in the data can make historical patterns unreliable for forecasting.  A model that doesn't account for these changes will likely have poor out-of-sample accuracy.\n* (D) A model that heavily relies on subjective judgment: Subjective judgment introduces bias and inconsistency, making it difficult to achieve reliable out-of-sample accuracy.\n* (E) A model that does not consider economic indicators: Economic indicators provide valuable information about the overall health of the economy and can significantly impact market behavior. Ignoring them can lead to inaccurate forecasts.\n* (G) A model that is based on a single variable:  A single variable may not capture all the relevant factors influencing the dependent variable, leading to limited predictive power.\n* (H) A model that predicts based on historical trends only:  Markets are dynamic, and relying solely on historical trends can be misleading if the underlying factors have changed.\n* (I) A model with a high degree of complexity: Complex models can be difficult to interpret and may overfit the data, leading to poor out-of-sample accuracy.\n* (J) A model that ignores market volatility: Market volatility is a key factor influencing asset prices.

    "rationale": "Here's the breakdown of the statements and why the correct answer is (A):\n\n* (A): The test statistic will follow a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis \n    * True. The likelihood ratio test statistic for nested models (like GARCH(2,2) vs. constant variance) asymptotically follows a chi-squared distribution. The degrees of freedom are determined by the difference in the number of parameters between the unrestricted and restricted models. In this case, the GARCH(2,2) has 4 parameters (2 for the ARCH component and 2 for the GARCH component), while the constant variance model has 0. The difference is 4 - 0 = 4. However, the null hypothesis restricts the GARCH parameters to zero, effectively reducing the number of parameters in the restricted model to 2 (one for the mean and one for the constant variance). Therefore, the degrees of freedom are 4 - 2 = 2.\n\n* (B): The value of the log-likelihood function will almost always be bigger for the restricted model than for the unrestricted model\n    * False. The unrestricted model (GARCH(2,2)) will generally have a higher log-likelihood value because it has more flexibility to fit the data. The restricted model (constant variance) is a special case of the GARCH(2,2) model, and it's unlikely to fit the data as well.\n\n* (C): If the relevant values of the log-likelihood functions are -112.3 and -118.4, the value of the test statistic is 12.2\n    * False. The likelihood ratio test statistic is calculated as twice the difference in the log-likelihood values: 2 * (-112.3 - (-118.4)) = 12.2. However, this is not the test statistic itself. The test statistic is the difference in the log-likelihood values multiplied by 2, which is 12.2.\n\n* (D): The likelihood ratio test compares the slopes of the log-likelihood function at the maximum and at the restricted parameter value.\n    * False. The likelihood ratio test compares the values of the log-likelihood function at the maximum likelihood estimates for both the unrestricted and restricted models. It doesn't directly compare the slopes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A). \n",

This allows firms to charge slightly higher prices than they could if their products were identical.\n* Free entry and exit: This means that firms can easily enter or exit the market, which keeps profits from becoming too high.\n\nThese characteristics have the following implications:\n\n* Firms have some market power: Because of product differentiation, firms can charge slightly higher prices than they could if their products were identical. However, this market power is limited because of the large number of competitors.\n* Competition is based on non-price factors: Firms compete with each other by differentiating their products, rather than by lowering prices. This can lead to a wide variety of products and services being offered to consumers.\n* Long-run profits are zero: Because of free entry and exit, firms cannot earn long-run profits.

Since there are currently 60 million cars for 240 million people, that's a ratio of 1 car for every 4 people.  With the population increase, we need enough cars for the additional 4.8 million people.

These prices don't necessarily reflect the true scarcity or demand for goods.\n* Capitalist economies rely on market forces (supply and demand) to determine prices. This means prices fluctuate based on how much consumers are willing to pay and how much producers are willing to supply.\n\nOption (I) accurately captures this difference, highlighting how market-determined prices reflect scarcity and demand, while centrally planned prices are used for different purposes. \n",

Examples include vaccinations (benefitting the community by reducing disease spread) or education (leading to a more informed and productive workforce).\n\n* Market Failure:  In a free market, the price mechanism typically leads to an equilibrium where the quantity produced and consumed reflects the private costs and benefits of the good. However, with positive externalities, the market equilibrium underestimates the true social benefits. This means that the market produces too little of the good compared to what would be socially optimal.\n\nLet's break down the answer choices:\n\n* (A) society produces too little of the good. This is the correct answer.  Positive externalities mean the market underestimates the full benefits, leading to underproduction.\n* (B) the social benefits from consuming the good exceed the private benefits. This is true, but it doesn't directly explain why it's a market failure.\n* (C) the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. This is also true, but it doesn't fully capture the concept of market failure.\n* (D) the marginal private benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. This is incorrect. With positive externalities, the marginal social benefit is higher than the marginal private benefit.\n* (E) the marginal social cost exceeds the marginal social benefit. This is incorrect. With positive externalities, the marginal social benefit is higher than the marginal social cost.\n* (F) the private costs from consuming the good exceed the social costs. This is incorrect. Positive externalities mean the social benefits exceed the private benefits.\n* (G) the private benefits from producing the good exceed the social benefits. This is incorrect. Positive externalities mean the social benefits exceed the private benefits.\n* (H) the private benefits from consuming the good exceed the social benefits. This is incorrect. Positive externalities mean the social benefits exceed the private benefits.\n* (I) the marginal private cost exceeds the marginal social benefit. This is incorrect. With positive externalities, the marginal social benefit is higher than the marginal private cost.\n* (J) society produces too much of the good. This is incorrect.

This means that even though they might fluctuate independently in the short term, they tend to move together in the long run.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n* (i)  $x_t$ and $y_t$ must both be stationary: This is incorrect. Cointegration specifically applies to *non-stationary* time series. If they were already stationary, there wouldn't be a need for cointegration.\n\n* (ii) Only one linear combination of $x_t$ and $y_t$ will be stationary: This is correct. The essence of cointegration is that a specific linear combination of the two non-stationary series will result in a stationary series. This combination represents the long-term equilibrium relationship.\n\n* (iii) The cointegrating equation for $x_t$ and $y_t$ describes the short-run relationship between the two series: This is incorrect. The cointegrating equation describes the *long-run* relationship. Short-term fluctuations can deviate from this long-term equilibrium.\n\n* (iv) The residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ must be stationary: This is correct.  A common way to test for cointegration is to regress one series on the other and check if the residuals of the regression are stationary. If they are, it suggests that the two series are cointegrated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D). \n",

Net increase of $1,300.\n    * Cash: Decreases by $700 (State of New York withdrawal).\n    * U.S. Securities: Increases by $1,000 (State of New York obligation purchase).\n* Liabilities and Capital:\n    * Demand deposits: Decreases by $700 (importer buying pounds).\n    * Deposits of states: Decreases by $700 (State of New York withdrawal) and increases by $1,000 (State of New York obligation purchase). Net increase of $300.\n\nCalculating Excess Reserves:\n\n1. Original Excess Reserves:\n    * Required Reserves: 24% of ($12,000 + $1,200) = $3,168\n    * Excess Reserves: $2,000 (cash) - $3,168 = -$1,168 \n    * Note: The bank is actually short of required reserves in the original situation.\n\n2. New Excess Reserves:\n    * Required Reserves: 24% of ($11,300 + $1,200) = $3,000\n    * Excess Reserves: ($2,000 - $700) (cash) + $1,300 (British bank) - $3,000 = $600\n\nAnswer: The excess reserves in the new situation are $600. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (F). \n",

This means that the production of goods and services automatically generates the income necessary to purchase those goods and services. In essence, Say's Law suggests that a general glut of goods is impossible because the act of producing goods creates the purchasing power to buy them.\n\nHowever, Say's Law has a significant weakness: it fails to consider that people may not spend all of their income.  Individuals and businesses can choose to save a portion of their income, which reduces the demand for goods and services.

A wider spread of the explanatory variable values (greater dispersion) provides more information about the relationship between the variables, leading to a more precise estimate of the slope and a smaller standard error.\n\n* (iii) The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size: This is true.  A larger sample size generally leads to more precise estimates, resulting in a smaller standard error.\n\n* (iv) The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate: This is the fundamental definition of the standard error.

This can happen due to several reasons:\n\n* (i) Slowness of response of the dependent variable to changes in the values of the independent variables: If the dependent variable is slow to react to changes in the independent variables, the residuals will be correlated. For example, if you are modeling the price of a stock, and the stock price is slow to react to changes in the company's earnings, the residuals will be correlated.\n* (ii) Over-reactions of the dependent variable to changes in the independent variables: If the dependent variable overreacts to changes in the independent variables, the residuals will also be correlated. For example, if you are modeling the number of people who visit a website, and the number of visitors overreacts to changes in the website's advertising budget, the residuals will be correlated.\n* (iii) Omission of relevant explanatory variables that are autocorrelated: If you omit a relevant explanatory variable that is autocorrelated, the residuals will also be autocorrelated. For example, if you are modeling the price of a house, and you omit the variable \"time of year,\" the residuals will be autocorrelated because the price of a house is likely to be higher in the spring and summer than in the fall and winter.\n* (iv) Outliers in the data: Outliers can also cause autocorrelated residuals.

If the data is non-stationary, the model will produce unreliable forecasts.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* (A): Coefficient estimates in VARs can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the relationships between the variables.\n* (B): VARs don't require all variables to have the same sign. The relationships between variables are captured by the coefficients, which can be positive or negative.\n* (C): While the coefficients in VARs don't have the same clear theoretical interpretations as in structural models, they still provide insights into the dynamic relationships between variables.\n* (D): VARs can sometimes produce better forecasts than simultaneous equation models, but this is not always the case. The choice depends on the specific data and model specifications.\n* (F): Coefficient estimates in VARs do have theoretical interpretations, although they are not as straightforward as in structural models.\n* (G): VARs are specifically designed for forecasting purposes.\n* (H): Non-stationary data will lead to unreliable forecasts in VAR models.\n* (I): VARs can often produce better forecasts than standalone variable models, especially when there are significant relationships between the variables. \n",

In this case, the break-even point is $8,000.\n\n* Calculations:\n    1. Calculate the amount spent above the break-even point: Since income is $10,000 and the break-even point is $8,000, the extra income is $2,000.\n    2. Calculate consumption above the break-even point:  Multiply the extra income by the MPC: $2,000 * (1/2) = $1,000.\n    3. Calculate total consumption: Add the consumption at the break-even point to the consumption above the break-even point: $8,000 + $1,000 = $9,000.\n    4. Calculate savings: Subtract total consumption from income: $10,000 - $9,000 = $1,000.\n\nAnswer: Consumption is $9,000 and $1,000 is saved. The answer is (F). \n",

VAR models are primarily data-driven and don't necessarily rely heavily on strong theoretical foundations. They are often used to explore relationships between variables without a priori assumptions about the underlying economic structure.\n\n* (ii) VARs in their reduced forms can be used easily to produce time-series forecasts - This is correct. VAR models, especially in their reduced form, are well-suited for forecasting. They capture the dynamic relationships between variables and can be used to predict future values.\n\n* (iii) VAR models are typically highly parsimonious - This is correct. VAR models can be parsimonious, meaning they use a relatively small number of parameters. This is a benefit because it reduces the risk of overfitting and makes the model easier to interpret.\n\n* (iv) OLS can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR - This is correct. In a reduced form VAR, each equation represents a variable as a function of its own lagged values and the lagged values of other variables. Since the equations are independent, ordinary least squares (OLS) can be applied separately to each equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C). \n",

Variance decomposition analysis helps us understand how much of the variation in each variable is explained by shocks to the other variables in the system.\n\n* (ii) Variance decompositions can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable: This is also TRUE.  Variance decomposition essentially breaks down the forecast error variance of each variable into the contributions from shocks to each of the variables in the VAR.\n\n* (iii) The ordering of the variables is important for calculating impulse responses but not variance decompositions: This is FALSE. The ordering of variables in a VAR model *does* affect variance decompositions. The order determines the direction of causality assumed in the model, which influences how shocks are propagated and how variance is attributed.\n\n* (iv) It is usual that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable: This is generally TRUE.  While not always the case, it's common for a significant portion of the forecast error variance of a variable to be explained by its own shocks.

The money multiplier effect amplifies this initial injection.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* Initial injection: The FED buys $100,000 worth of bonds, increasing the bank's reserves by $100,000.\n* Reserve requirement: The required reserve ratio is 10%, meaning the bank must hold 10% of its deposits as reserves.\n* Loanable funds: The bank can now lend out the remaining 90% of the $100,000, which is $90,000.\n* Money multiplier: This $90,000 loan becomes a deposit in another bank, increasing that bank's reserves. This process continues, with each bank lending out 90% of its new reserves, creating a multiplier effect.\n\nThe money multiplier is calculated as 1 / reserve requirement ratio. In this case, it's 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the total increase in the money supply is the initial injection multiplied by the money multiplier: $100,000 * 10 = $1,000,000.\n\nThe answer is (G). \n",

In this case, MPC = 0.90, meaning 90% of any income increase is spent.\n* Income Tax Rate: This is the percentage of income that is collected as taxes. Here, the tax rate is 0.26, meaning 26% of income is taxed.\n* Withdrawals: These are the components of income that are not spent on consumption. In this context, withdrawals include savings (1 - MPC) and taxes.\n\nCalculation\n\n1. Savings: For each level of output, calculate savings as (1 - MPC) * Output.\n2. Taxes: For each level of output, calculate taxes as Tax Rate * Output.\n3. Total Withdrawals: Add savings and taxes for each level of output.\n\nExample for $1,100 billion Output:\n\n* Savings: (1 - 0.90) * $1,100 billion = $110 billion\n* Taxes: 0.26 * $1,100 billion = $286 billion\n* Total Withdrawals: $110 billion + $286 billion = $396 billion\n\nRepeat this calculation for each level of output.\n\nImportance of the Calculation\n\nThis calculation is crucial because it helps us understand the relationship between income, spending, and withdrawals in the economy.

In these cases, the burden of the tax would fall more heavily on the side of the market that is perfectly elastic.\n* (C), (D), (E), (I): These scenarios involve a mix of elastic and inelastic curves. While the burden would be shared, the side with the more inelastic curve would bear a larger portion of the tax burden.\n\nIn summary: When both demand and supply are price inelastic, consumers are less likely to change their consumption patterns in response to a price increase, making them bear the largest burden of the excise tax. \n",

Since TFC increases, AFC will also increase, shifting the AFC curve upward.\n* Average Variable Cost (AVC) shifts upward:  While capital is fixed, labor is a variable input.  To maintain the same level of output with higher capital costs, the firm will likely need to use more labor (a variable cost). This will increase the firm's total variable costs and thus its AVC.\n* Marginal Cost (MC) shifts upward: MC is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output.  Since both fixed and variable costs are increasing, the cost of producing an additional unit will also increase, shifting the MC curve upward.\n\nImportant Note: The average total cost (ATC) curve will also shift upward because it is the sum of AFC and AVC. \n",

This is because the demand for the resources will become more balanced across both countries.\n\nIn summary:  Trade will cause the price of capital to increase in the rural country (as they import goods requiring capital) and the price of land to increase in the industrial country (as they import goods requiring land).

As a result, producers produce more of the good than is socially optimal, leading to an underallocation of resources.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* (A): spillover benefits are received by society. This describes a positive externality, not a negative one.\n* (B): total welfare is maximized.  This is not true in the presence of a negative externality. Total welfare is reduced because the social cost is not fully accounted for.\n* (C): the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost. This is the condition for allocative efficiency, which is not achieved in the presence of a negative externality.\n* (D): the marginal private benefit equals the marginal social cost. This is the condition for market equilibrium, which is not the same as social efficiency in the presence of a negative externality.\n* (E): there are no spillover benefits or costs to society.

Parsimony refers to using the fewest parameters possible.  An ARCH(q) model has 'q' parameters for the lagged squared returns, while a GARCH(1,1) has two parameters (one for the lagged conditional variance and one for the lagged squared return).  For a given level of complexity, ARCH(q) will generally have fewer parameters.\n\n* (ii) The ARCH(q) model is the more likely to violate non-negativity constraints: This is true.  The ARCH(q) model directly models the conditional variance as a linear combination of past squared returns.  If the coefficients are negative, the conditional variance can become negative, which is impossible. GARCH(1,1) models, with their additional parameter, are less prone to this issue.\n\n* (iii) The ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance: This is true.  The ARCH(q) model explicitly includes 'q' lags of squared returns.  While 'q' is finite, it can be a large number, effectively allowing for a significant number of past lags to influence the current conditional variance.\n\n* (iv) The GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance: This is false.  While GARCH(1,1) is often a good starting point, it's not guaranteed to capture all the dependence in the conditional variance.  More complex GARCH models (e.g., GARCH(p,q) with higher orders) or other models like the EGARCH model might be needed for a better fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (F): (i), (ii), and (iii) only \n",

    "rationale": "The correct answer is (I): Recognition lag and decision lag. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* Recognition Lag: This is the time it takes to realize that an economic problem exists. It can be difficult to distinguish between normal fluctuations and a true economic downturn.\n* Decision Lag: This is the time it takes for policymakers to decide on a course of action after recognizing the problem. This can involve gathering data, analyzing the situation, and debating policy options.\n\nThe other options are not as directly related to the time lags in economic stabilization policy:\n\n* (A) Decision lag and effect lag:  While decision lag is accurate, \"effect lag\" is too broad.\n* (B) Recognition lag and implementation lag: Implementation lag is part of the overall time lag, but not a distinct category like recognition lag.\n* (C) Implementation lag and evaluation lag: Evaluation lag is about assessing the effectiveness of the policy, not a primary time lag.\n* (D) Communication lag and stabilization lag: These are not standard terms in economic policy analysis.\n* (E) Action lag and outside lag: These are not standard terms in economic policy analysis.\n* (F) Inside time-lag and outside lag: These are not standard terms in economic policy analysis.\n* (G) Administrative lag and operational lag: These are not standard terms in economic policy analysis.\n* (H) Policy lag and response lag: These are not standard terms in economic policy analysis.\n* (J) Inside lag and decision lag: Inside lag is a broader term encompassing both recognition and decision lags. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is (I): Recognition lag and decision lag. \n",

Sell 1 pound for 6 marks.\n2. Convert 6 marks to $2.40 (6 marks * $0.40/mark).\n3. Convert $2.40 to 1.2 pounds ($2.40 / $2.00/pound).\n\nThe Englishman would end up with 1.2 pounds, making a profit of 0.2 pounds for every pound he traded.\n\nThe answer is (E). \n",

This presents a disadvantage to owners of corporations because they are taxed twice on the same income.\n\nHere's how corporations attempt to avoid double taxation:\n\n* (C): Through use of undistributed corporate profits and disguise of profits in the form of high salaries, pension, and expense accounts  This is a common strategy. By retaining profits within the corporation, shareholders avoid paying dividends and the associated double taxation.  Disguising profits as expenses or high salaries also reduces the taxable income of the corporation.\n\nWhile other options might have some impact on taxation, they are not primary methods for avoiding double taxation:\n\n* (A): Through reinvesting profits into tax-exempt securities  This reduces the corporation's taxable income but doesn't directly address double taxation.\n* (B): Through merging with or acquiring other companies to consolidate tax liabilities This can help optimize tax strategies but doesn't eliminate double taxation.\n* (D): Through issuing stock options to employees instead of cash salaries This is a compensation strategy, not a direct method for avoiding double taxation.\n* (E): Through increased dividend distribution This actually *increases* double taxation.\n* (F): Through high corporate income tax This is a consequence of corporate taxation, not a method for avoiding double taxation.\n\nThe answer is (C) \n",

This means people buy less of it when they have more money.\n* Income Effect: The income effect refers to how changes in income affect the quantity demanded of a good. For an inferior good, the income effect is negative – a price decrease (which effectively increases purchasing power) leads to a decrease in quantity demanded.\n* Substitution Effect: The substitution effect refers to how changes in relative prices affect the quantity demanded of a good.  A price decrease makes the good relatively cheaper, leading to an increase in quantity demanded.\n\nWhy (B) is correct:\n\nIf the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect for an inferior good, the decrease in quantity demanded due to the income effect outweighs the increase in quantity demanded due to the substitution effect.

Since capital is fixed, we cannot assess returns to scale.\n* Labor Saturation: While labor saturation could be a factor, the information provided doesn't explicitly suggest it.\n* Labor Specialization Efficiency:  The information doesn't provide details about specialization, so we can't assume it's the primary driver.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (I). \n",

Antithetic variates help reduce variance, which in turn allows for fewer replications to achieve a desired level of accuracy.\n* (ii) Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically: This is incorrect. Antithetic variates don't involve a separate variable with known properties.\n* (iii) Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws: This is correct. This is the core principle of antithetic variates. By using negatively correlated random numbers, you reduce the overall variance of the simulation.\n* (iv) Antithetic variates involve taking one over each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws: This is incorrect. Taking the reciprocal of random draws doesn't necessarily create negatively correlated values, which is the key to antithetic variates. \n\nTherefore, only statements (i) and (iii) are correct. \n",

Deposits Decrease: The bank's deposits decrease by $10,000 to $240,000.\n2. Reserves Decrease: The bank's reserves also decrease by $10,000 to $52,500.\n3. Required Reserves: The bank's required reserves are now 25% of $240,000 = $60,000.\n4. Excess Reserves: The bank has $52,500 - $60,000 = -$7,500 in excess reserves. This means the bank is now short of required reserves.\n\nImpact on Money Supply:\n\n* Initial Money Multiplier: The initial money multiplier was 1/r = 1/0.25 = 4. This means every dollar of reserves could support $4 in the money supply.\n* Reduced Money Multiplier: Since the bank is short of reserves, it cannot create new loans. This effectively reduces the money multiplier.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe withdrawal of $10,000 directly reduces the money supply by $10,000.

Air, while essential for life, has a very low marginal utility because we consume it constantly.  Since we have an abundance of air, consuming a little more or less doesn't significantly change our overall satisfaction.  This means the additional utility gained from consuming more air is close to zero.  \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E). \n",
